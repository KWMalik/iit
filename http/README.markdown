* Let's just start with TCP and sockets (echoserver)
  * Why doesn't `curl` work with echoserver?

* Make `curl` work with httpserver
* Great, but that's a lot of code (httpserver2)

* Well, neat, but "Thanks!" isn't all that useful (fileserver)
  * What is HTTP?
  * ¿¿Request Methods
  * URIs
  * Status Codes

* What if you want to attach your language to my webserver? (CGI)

* State: cookies?

* Rails or Sinatra?

* Jersey or Spring?
