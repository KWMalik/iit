    <h1>Maintaining Client State in HTTP</h1>
    <p>
      Check out <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2109">RFC 2109</a>.
      You should also take a look at <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965">RFC 2965</a>, which defines a possible future for Cookies.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to be able to "track" an individual client across
      many requests, you're probably going to want to use HTTP Cookies.
      Cookies are not part of the HTTP specification, but thanks to the
      flexibility of HTTP, Cookies can exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Basically, the server writes to a header called
      <code>Set-Cookie</code> in a response. In the value will be details
      about the specific cookie. The client (i.e. the browser)
      specifically knows about this special header and will store the
      data. On subsequent requests to that <code>host:port</code>
      and <code>path</code>, the browser will send down the previously
      stored Cookie(s) in a request header. The server can see these
      and thus make decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in a Set-Cookie header?</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>NAME=VALUE</dt>
      <dd>
        The name of your cookie and a value you want to record.
        This is required.
      </dd>

      <dt>version=number</dt>
      <dd>
        The HTTP Cookie spec this cookie adheres to; just set it to "1".
        This is required.
      </dd>

      <dt>domain=domain-name</dt>
      <dd>
        The domain this cookie is to be used with.
        <code>www.example.com</code> is not the same as
        <code>.example.com</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt>path=url-path</dt>
      <dd>
        The path prefix that this cookie is to be used with. To work
        with any path, use <code>/</code> or don't define this field.
        Setting <code>path=/foo/bar</code> would mean that the cookie
        would not work with <code>/</code> or even </code>/foo</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt>max-age=seconds</dt>
      <dd>
        The number of seconds (form now) the cookie is valid for.
        Defining no max-age is akin to a session cookie, meaning the
        client can throw the cookie away when the user closes the
        browser (for instance). It is the client's responsibility to
        enforce this time limit.
      </dd>

      <dt>comments=string</dt>
      <dd>
        A description of what the cookie is used by the server for.
        Not often used.
      </dd>

      <dt>secure</dt>
      <dd>
        This is a valueless attribute whose existence declares that
        the cookie should only be used in secure communications.
        Generally, this means HTTPS.
      </dd>

    </dl>
  
    <h2>What you'll get back</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>NAME=VALUE[; NAME=VALUE]*</dt>
      <dd>
        On the next and perhaps subsequent requests (should the cookie still be alive)
        you'll receive a series of appropriate key=value pairs of cookies in a header
        named <code>Cookie</code>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
