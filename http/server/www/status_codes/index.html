    <h1>Status Codes</h1>
    <p>
      Check out <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10">RFC 2616 / Section 10</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Status codes are extremely important in responses as they indicate to the client how it
      should behave up receipt of the response. These codes are very meaningful, as you will
      come to find out when you start working with RESTful services.

    <dl>
      <dt>1XXs - Informational</dt>
      <dd>
        I've still not had to use any code in this branch (100 or 101).
      </dd>

      <dt>2XXs - Successful</dt>
      <dd>
        The most common are 200 (OK), 201 (Created), and 204 (No Content).
      </dd>

      <dt>3XXs - Redirection</dt>
      <dd>
        Essentially, these codes tell the client something about the resource's state.
        301 (Moved Permanently), 302 (Found/Moved Temporarily), and 304 (Not Modified) are common.

        <p>
          QUESTION: What's another way we could load <code>/status_codes/index.html</code> if
          <code>/status_codes</code> is requested? Who wants to see what that looks like?
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>4XXs - Client Error</dt>
      <dd>
        Whoops! The client goofed somehow.

        <p>404 (Not Found) is used when the resource cannot be found at all.</p>
        <p>400 (Bad Request) generally means there was something wrong the request (or invalid data was passed).</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>5XXs - Server Error</dt>
      <dd>
        Something really crazy happened on the server.

        <p>500 (Internal Server Error) - you better implement some fault tolerance into your app.</p>
      </dd>
